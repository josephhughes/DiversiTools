============

Tool for analysing viral diversity from High Throughput Sequencing (HTS)

High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) has enabled the study of viruses beyond the single consensus sequence. Viruses often exist as a swarm of related viruses and understanding the diversity within this swarm has become a focus of research for the virology community. Diversitools allows biologists to explore and analyse the diversity of the viral population within their HTS datasets.
